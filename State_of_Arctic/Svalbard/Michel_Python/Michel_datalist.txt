Sea ice concentration from NSIDC NASA Team algorithn
Sea ice concentration from NSIDC Boostrap algorithm 
TOPAZ ocean reanalysis (for the ocean temperature at depths)
ERA-I reanalysis for the surface 2m temperature and for the SST (I think this gave the problematic SST) 
OSTIA SST 
PIOMAS sea ice thickness (model only result)

Sea ice concentration

from ice concentration monthly folder -https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/files/nsidcCDRiceSQnhmday/
​I don't have access to the NSDIC that the glaciersinterpolatedConcentrations code is run off

Surface temperature
